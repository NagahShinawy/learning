# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects, scripts, and notes I've gathered while learning Python, Django, and automation. Each course or learning path is organized into its own branch, allowing you to easily navigate and focus on specific topics.

## Repository Overview

This repository is structured into various branches, each dedicated to a particular course or topic within Python development:

### 1. **Python Basics** (`branch: python-basics`)
   - Beginner-friendly Python scripts covering fundamental concepts like data types, control structures, functions, and modules.
   - Exercises and examples to reinforce core Python concepts.

### 2. **Advanced Python** (`branch: advanced-python`)
   - Deep dives into advanced Python topics such as decorators, generators, context managers, and metaclasses.
   - Best practices for writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code.

### 3. **Django Web Development** (`branch: django-web-development`)
   - Projects and tutorials on building web applications using the Django framework.
   - Concepts like models, views, templates, middleware, and Django REST framework for building APIs.
   - Real-world examples, from simple websites to complex web applications.

### 4. **Automation with Python** (`branch: automation-with-python`)
   - Scripts and tools for automating everyday tasks using Python.
   - Examples include web scraping, file management, data processing, and automated testing.
   - Practical use cases demonstrating how Python can simplify and streamline workflows.

### 5. **Testing and Debugging** (`branch: testing-and-debugging`)
   - Resources and examples on writing tests for Python code using tools like `unittest`, `pytest`, and Djangoâ€™s testing framework.
   - Debugging techniques and tools to troubleshoot and fix issues in your Python projects.

### 6. **Learning Resources** (`branch: learning-resources`)
   - A curated list of tutorials, articles, and books that have been helpful in my Python learning journey.
   - Links to online courses, coding challenges, and other educational materials.

## Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Before working with any of the projects in this repository, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment. Below are the instructions for both Ubuntu and Windows systems.

### On Ubuntu

#### Step 1: Install Python and pip

Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

#### Step 2: Install `venv` (If Not Already Installed)

The `venv` module is included with Python 3.3 and later, but if it's not installed on your system, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

#### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

This command creates a directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

#### Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you're working within the virtual environment.

#### Step 5: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install any required dependencies using `pip`. For example, if there's a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will return you to your system's default Python environment.

### On Windows

#### Step 1: Install Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and make sure to check the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

#### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This command creates a directory named `venv` containing the virtual environment.

#### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```cmd
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once activated, your command prompt will change to indicate that you're working within the virtual environment.

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install any required dependencies using `pip`. For example, if there's a `requirements.txt` file:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 5: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```cmd
deactivate
```

This will return you to your system's default Python environment.
